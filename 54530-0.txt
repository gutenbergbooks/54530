   Each of your eyes.”

          THE

     KNIFE-GRINDER’s

        BUDGET

          OF

   _Pictures & Poetry_,

          FOR

     BOYS AND GIRLS.


         OTLEY:

 PRINTED BY WILLIAM WALKER.

         1829.




THE BUDGET


[Illustration]

 “Come buy my fine Apples,”
    The old Woman cries,
 “You cannot have better
    For eating or pies.”




[Illustration]

 The Huxter and Donkey
     Are both on their legs:
 They’re going to market
     For butter and eggs.




[Illustration]

 The Barber, of all men,
     Is most full of news,
 And ever detested
     By long-bearded Jews.




[Illustration]

 “Well, Richard, you’re mounted
     Again, I declare!”
 “Yes, riding is better
     Than walking, by far!”




[Illustration]

 The Goat on the crag
     You see fast asleep;
 From whence he can leap,
     Tho’ it’s ever so steep.




[Illustration]

 The Child and Miss Pussy
     Do play very nice;
 But Pussy had much rather
     Play with some mice.




[Illustration]

 “Be quick as a Lamp-lighter!”
     Sometimes we say:
 Here’s one upon duty
     Fast tripping away.




[Illustration]

 O, Keeper! thy visage
     Is dreadful indeed!
 Thy presence I’ll flee
     With all possible speed.




[Illustration]

 Here comes for the Butcher
     A fine lusty Calf,
 For the killing of which
     He perhaps will get half.




[Illustration]

 Potatoes are useful,
     If they be but good:
 The ground must be till’d,
     Or we cannot have food.




[Illustration]

 That Hound, I dare say,
     Won’t like the Boy’s whip;
 Could he break the cord,
     He would give him the slip.




[Illustration]

 Poor Jack! I’m afraid
     That thy bum will be sore:
 That footmen were boot-jacks
     I ne’er knew before.




[Illustration]

 You here see a poor man
     Repairing a chair;
 He sits on the ground,
     Quite expos’d to the air.




[Illustration]

 Silk, Cotton, and Sugar,
     And Coffee, and Tea,
 Are fetch’d by the sailors
     Across the great sea.




[Illustration]

 Poor Tray seems inclin’d
     With Matilda to dine:
 He wants but the meat,—
     He would leave her the wine.




[Illustration]

 Come buy my fat Rabbits,
     Come, Ladies, and buy;
 With mutton they make
     A most excellent pie.




[Illustration]

 When the Hen calls her Chickens,
     They follow straight-way;
 So Children should always
     Their Parents obey.




[Illustration]

 You see the old Laundress
     At work in her drills;
 But I fear she’s too old
     To crimp you your frills.




[Illustration]

 “Buy a good sweeping-brush,—
     Hand-brushes buy,—
 I’ll sell you cheap brushes,”—
     The old man doth cry.




[Illustration]

 This Lady of pleasure
     Is taking fresh air;
 Which may do very well,
     If the weather keep fair.




[Illustration]

 Poor Ned, I’m afraid,
     Cannot meet with his horse;
 He seems quite distracted
     At so great a loss.




[Illustration]

 The Girl you see swinging,
     If the band only break,
 Will be in great danger
     Of breaking her neck.




[Illustration]

 A Bull-baiting now
     Puts an end to my book:
 The scene is so cruel,
     I can scarce bear to look.




_W. Walker, Printer, Otley._




        THE
   KNIFE-GRINDER’S
       BUDGET.

[Illustration]

 Old Billy, poor man!
   Is depriv’d of his sight,
 But still with his music
   Produces delight.

  PRICE ONE PENNY.
